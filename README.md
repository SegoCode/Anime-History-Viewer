Simple, copy, paste your animes and share, simply an alternative to anime list services like [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) or [anilist](https://anilist.co/), if you have an animesCompleted.txt and you dont want have an account in these services just for share your animes one time a year with your friend, this fix this.

## Usage & info
Under the hood this web work whith [jikan API](https://jikan.moe/) so there some things to keep in mind: 

- Rate Limiting Per Minute 60 requests (May be the animes load slow )
- Doesn't have backend, so when it shared all information need to stay in URL, (I recommend you use a link shortener)
